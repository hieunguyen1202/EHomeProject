<strong>The EHome website </strong> was developed by Java. The website includes some main features, such as a list of rooms, houses, or apartments by category. The user can search by address. The EHome has three roles: administrator, owner, and renter. <br>
- The user shall view in detail this room, house, or apartment so that they can propose a request to the owner.
- The owner shall be able to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) this room or house and accept requests from renters.
- The admin shall update the role account and view the list of rooms, houses, and apartments available for rental.
